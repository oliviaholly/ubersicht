## Installation

Clone this repository to your widgets folder (default: ~/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets).

### Sonos

For Sonos support you need to install [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo), a Python Sonos Controller, `pip install soco`. You also need to adjust the IP address to your speaker inside `current_track.py`. You can find the IP address by going to "About Sonos" inside the Sonos desktop application.
